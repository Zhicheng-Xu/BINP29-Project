# BINP29-Project
SeqGraph is a software to stimulate the assembly process of Velvet. This program will split the input sequence into K-mers for input K valueand generate a De Bruijn graph and reassemble the sequence to calculate the similarity between the original sequence and the new one.  
Users need to input a nucleotide sequence and an integer for K value to gennerate the corresponding De Bruijn graph and sequence assembly. The results would be displayed on a web page based on web programming.  
The 'static' directory is for image storage. For each different sequence input, users need to clear this directory manually except for the background image 'network.png' which is used to build the web page. This is because browser cache would remember the existing imaged even though the image has been replaced in the directory.
